                    <p class="flex-info">My own journey has taken me through challenges, loss and heartbreak. At times hedonistic pursuits were the answer as I sought resolution at the bottom of a glass or solace in the wrong relationship.  
                        <br><br>
                        Iâ€™ve previously spent 23 years working in the fashion retail industry.  The corporate world brought success and accomplishment but also delivered chronic exhaustion and disillusionment.  I was left longing for meaning and connection in my life.
                        <br><br>
                        My healing process has led me through a blend of shamanic work, Buddhist practice and meditation; supporting me to turn inward. Valuable work with indigenous tribes has allowed me to learn valuable and sacred practices to integrate into my own world. This work is ongoing.
                        <br><br>
                        I have a Postgraduate Diploma in Counselling and Psychotherapy. My formal training is in Integrative and Transpersonal Psychotherapy. I have trauma training and experience in supporting those who have suffered emotional, physical or sexual abuse in childhood.</p>
