            <p class="info">
              Session fee is Â£75 for face to face and online in all
              locations. I offer a limited amount of low cost slots and sliding
              scale appointments are available.
              <br><br>
              I am based in Margate but also practice in Paddington London (W2) and Faversham
              Kent throughout the week. I also work online. I offer an
              introductory and complimentary 20 minute session so you can get a
              sense of whether we are a good fit. There is no obligation to
              commit beyond that. Therapy session duration is 50 minutes and
              ideally occurs once a week. We will regularly review how therapy
              is progressing, and totally up to you how many sessions you feel
              you need. The length of this can range from a few weeks to a
              number of years.
