              Our lives are unfolding in a context of increasing unease and
              uncertainty. The demands and perpetual hum of our busy lives often creates fog and overwhelm. Unexpected life events paralyse
              us.
              <br /><br />
              We can feel lost and disconnected from ourselves, our lives and
              relationships; stuck in endless cycles and unhealthy patterns.
              It sometimes feels all paths lead to nowhere.
              <br /><br />
              I offer a space to rest, take a breath and take the weight
              off. To sit back and gently untangle what is in front of us.
              <br /><br />
              Connecting back to ourselves is essential in uncovering what truly
              needs tending to. From here, light and potential can be found. We
              can open up to fresh possibility and a new direction.

              As a transpersonal integrative psychotherapist. I am clinically
              trained in multiple modalities. This allows me to adapt my
              approach to meet your unique needs.
              <br /><br />
              Transpersonal means that my approach is holistic; bringing the
              body, mind and soul in harmony to accomplish healing and growth.
              If sometimes language evades us, we can work with creative
              expression, dreams and mindfulness to create breakthroughs. This
              can mean listening to the body or checking in with the senses
              whilst we work, connecting with what is true and authentic.
              <br /><br />
              I believe therapy is a collaborative process of careful listening
              and supportive dialogue. By creating a secure foundation of trust
              and safety, we allow unconscious patterns and self-limiting beliefs
              to move into the light to be witnessed and released. Most
              importantly, our work together will help cultivate an inner
              guidance for you to take out into your life and relationships.
              <br /><br />
              Whatever the issue, I aim to walk alongside you to uncover your
              concerns, untangle what is stuck and be there to witness and celebrate
              your progress.

              After studying Psychology at Leeds University, I spent 20+ years
              in the fashion retail industry, leading large teams in creative
              and project management. The corporate world delivered not only
              success and accomplishment but also chronic exhaustion and
              disillusionment.
              <br /><br />
              My path had brought personal struggle and inner turmoil. I’d
              sought answers in the wrong places. I embarked on a new journey of
              discovery through a blend of therapy, shamanic work, meditation,
              Buddhist and tantra practice. These have all supported me to turn
              inward and heal, becoming sacred practices to integrate into my
              work as a therapist.
              <br /><br />
              My formal training is in integrative and transpersonal
              psychotherapy; receiving a Post-Graduate diploma at the Centre of
              Counselling and Psychotherapy Education (CCPE) and I'm also a member of the
              UKCP. 
              <br><br>
              I have trauma training experience in supporting those
              who have suffered emotional, physical or sexual abuse in
              childhood.
