                        <p class="info">I understand how life can feel overwhelming as we move through difficult periods and life transitions. As a result, we may experience deep anxiety, fear and loss; amongst other difficult emotions.<br><br>  I aim to walk alongside you throughout your process to help gently uncover what is concerning you as well as support awareness and growth. <br><br>Through my own journey I’ve realised that pain and agony are often the very nutrients from which new shoots of potential can grow.  I believe therapy is a collaborative process of careful listening and supportive dialogue.  I provide a confidential, safe space and offer warmth and authenticity.
                            <br><br>I have a Postgraduate Diploma in Counselling and Psychotherapy from the Centre for Counselling and Psychotherapy Education (CCPE) in London. My formal training is in Integrative and Transpersonal Psychotherapy. I have trauma training in supporting those who have suffered emotional, physical or sexual abuse in childhood.</p>
