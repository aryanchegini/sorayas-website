              We live against a backdrop of unease and the perpetual hum of
              demand on our time and energy can bring a fog of overwhelm.
              <br /><br />
              We just can’t get a moment…
              <br /><br />
              We can feel lost and disconnected from ourselves, stuck in
              perpetual cycles. Our lives and relationships feel
              confused. It sometimes feels all paths lead to nowhere.
              <br /><br />
              I offer a space to rest, take the weight off, take a breath, take
              the weight off,. To sit back and gently untangle what is in front
              of us.
              <br /><br />
              Connecting back to ourselves is essential in order to notice what
              we need to attend to. From here light and potential can be found,
              so we open up to fresh possibility and a new direction.

              A transpersonal integrative psychotherapist, I am clinically
              trained in multiple modalities. This allows me to adjust to your
              unique needs. 
              <br><br>
              I aim to walk alongside you throughout your progress as we gently uncover what concerns you.
              <br>
              Therapy is a collaborative process of careful listening and
              supportive dialogue. If sometimes language evades us, we can work
              with creative expression, dreams and mindfulness. My approach
              is holistic; bringing the body, mind and soul in harmony to
              accomplish healing and growth. This can mean listening to the body
              or checking in with the senses whilst we work, connecting with
              what is true and authentic. 
              <br><br>
              The therapeutic relationship is the
              core of my work.
              It takes time to build trust and safety.
              Through this process a secure foundation can grow. Unconscious
              patterns and self-limiting beliefs move into the light to be
              witnessed and released. This creates the confidence to tread
              unexplored paths. This work will help cultivate an inner guidance
              to take out into your life and relationships.

              After studying Psychology at Leeds University I spent 23 years in
              the fashion retail industry leading large teams in creative and
              project management. The corporate world brought not only success
              and accomplishment but also delivered chronic exhaustion and
              disillusionment. 
              <br>
              I was left wondering ‘Is this it?’
              <br><br>
              My journey left me grappling with personal struggle and inner turmoil. I’d
              sought answers in the wrong places. I embarked on a new journey of
              discovery through a blend of therapy, shamanic work, Buddhist and
              tantra practice and meditation. These have all supported me to
              turn inward and heal, allowing valuable and sacred practices to
              integrate into my work as a therapist. 
              <br><br>
              My formal training is in integrative and transpersonal Psychotherapy. I also have trauma
              training experience in supporting those who have suffered
              emotional, physical or sexual abuse in childhood.
